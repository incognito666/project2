# Project 2: Bad Smell and Feature Extractor
CSC 510  
Software Engineering

# 1.Collection  

We are using the already provided gitable.py with few modifications.  
We have modified gitable to include some information from the Github API, write the data into a text file with comma separated values, and added our anonymization logic.  

# 2.Anonymization   

We use a simple replacement algorithm for anonymizing the data; every unique name in the project repo is replaced by an alphabet.  


```python  
if user not in users.keys():    
      users[user] = chr(name_i)  
      name_i+=1     
user = users[user]  
```   

`name_i` has been initialized with 65. Hence, `chr(name_i)` will give us the character of that ASCII integer.

# Data   

We are detecting bad smells from three projects:  
1) [Tarantula in Python] (https://api.github.com/repos/incognito666/tarantula-python/issues/)    
2) [Web Scraper] (https://api.github.com/repos/SuperCh-SE-NCSU/ProjectScraping/issues/)    
3) [Maze] (https://api.github.com/repos/CSC510-2015-Axitron/maze/issues/)     

For each project, we collected the following data:  
- The issue number
- When the milestones (that a particular issue was assigned to) were closed
- The total number of milestones that were assigned a particular issue
- When a issue was opened
- The name of the issue
- When each milestone was created
- The name of each milestone
- When each milestone was updated
- The number of comments per milestone
- When the milestone was closed
- When the milestone was due
- How long a milestone was 'alive'  

# Data Samples  

When gitable_27.py (our modified version of gitable.py) is executed for each project, all the data is redirected into a comma separated text file.    

[Data_Output.txt for Tarantula] (https://github.com/incognito666/project2/blob/master/Data_Output.txt)      
[Data_Output2.txt for Web Scraper] (https://github.com/incognito666/project2/blob/master/Data_Output2.txt)   
[Data_Output3.txt for Maze] (https://github.com/incognito666/project2/blob/master/Data_Output3.txt)  

A typical issue in the data output files is as below:
```
ISSUE 2
milestone_closed : 1425138166.0,	milestone_total : 6,	opened : 1423886852.0,	what : question,	milestone_created : 1424976835.0,	milestone_name : Get coverage code up and running,	when : 1423943521.0,	updated : 1424977031.0,	comments : 1,	ended : 1423934053.0,	milestone_due : 1424926800.0,	user : C,	action : labeled,	alive : 47201.0
