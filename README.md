# Project 2: Bad Smell and Feature Extractor
CSC 510  
Software Engineering

# 1.Collection  

We are using the already provided gitable.py with few modifications.  
We have modified gitable to include some information from the Github API, write the data into a text file with comma separated values, and added our anonymization logic.  

# 2.Anonymization   

We use a simple replacement algorithm for anonymizing the data; every unique name in the project repo is replaced by an alphabet.  

<inline>
if user not in users.keys():
      users[user] = chr(name_i)
      name_i+=1
    user = users[user]
